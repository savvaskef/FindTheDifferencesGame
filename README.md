This is an old school App </br>
You either load the .sln files and hit run</br>
or</br>
you navigate to .....\bin\release\ </br>
and execute </br>
differences.exe</br>
<hr>
Once the app loads</br>
you have the choice to navigate</br>
to the Player or the Editor</br>
<hr>
Editor adds to the MS-SQL Compact CE database</br>
the differencess' location of a given set of pictures</br>
by drawing rectangles on the picture</br>
</br>
while the Player</br>
gives you the option to select a set and then</br>
spot the differences on the pictures</br>
</br>
Finally there are Hint and Print buttons</br>
<hr>
