This is an old school App 
You either load the .sln files and hit run
or
you navigate to .....\bin\release\ 
and execute 
differences.exe

Once the app loads
you have the choice to navigate
to the Player or the Editor

Editor adds to the database
the differencess' location of a given set of pictures
by drawing rectangles on the picture

while the Player
gives you the option to select a set and then
spot the differences on the pictures

Finally there are Hint and Print buttons
